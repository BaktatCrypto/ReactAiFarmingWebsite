            We use personal data to operate the website and insofar as this is
            necessary to provide a functional website and our content and
            services, in particular, to protect our IT systems from attacks and
            other illegal activities. The collection and use of personal data
            take place with the consent of the user unless legal regulations
            prevent the processing of the data. To fulfill the processing
            purposes, data is also transferred to third parties. This may also
            include the transfer of personal data to European and non-European
            countries and the storage of data outside the EU or the European
            Economic Area (EEA). In the event of the use of service providers
            and the disclosure of your personal data to third parties, with your
            consent, personal data may be transferred to recipients in countries
            outside the EU, such as Liechtenstein, and processed there. If we
            pass on data to service providers bound by instructions, we do so
            based on a data processing agreement and no further separate request
            is required. Insofar as any of the above-mentioned data transfers
            are made to a recipient outside the EEA (to so-called “third
            countries”), an appropriate level of data protection for the foreign
            transfer is ensured by means of suitable security measures. For data
            transfers within the <span class="baktat">BAKTAT</span> Token
            network, our companies have, among other things, concluded an
            internal data protection agreement which provides for compliance
            with the EU standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission within
            the meaning of Art 46 para 2 lit c) GDPR for the transfer of
            personal data from EU/EEA countries to
            <span class="baktat">BAKTAT</span>.ai companies outside the EU/EEA.
            If you have any questions about such data protection contracts based
            on the EU standard contractual clauses or if you would like more
            information about further security mechanisms and security measures
            for the transfer of data to third countries, please feel free to
